# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves predicting future stock prices using historical data. The notebook applies machine learning techniques to train a model that forecasts stock prices, providing valuable insights for traders and investors.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` or install them directly using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
  ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Prediction_Model.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the cells**:
   - Step through the cells in the notebook to load data, train the model, and visualize the predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model to predict stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices for better analysis.

## Results

The model provides a visual representation of the actual and predicted stock prices, allowing users to evaluate the model's performance.
